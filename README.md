# My First Gitpod Project

You can view my project here: https://danielmcmanus.github.io/first-gitpod-project/

This project is simply a practice for using Gitpod with Github to use all the feautures throughout the start to the end of a project.

Here we are only using some basic HTMl and CSS styles to create a very simple site.

## Notes for a README file

A README file is essential and should contain some of the follwing items

- A link to the live deployed project
- Helps the reader to understand what the project does
- What technologies have been used 
- What features you would like to add
- Gives credit from any code taken from other places
